Beforehand, make sure  you had exported the required environment variables.

```sh
export CPLEX_STUDIO_DIR="/opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio201/"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio201/opl/bin/x86-64_linux/

For running several instances at once, you can use the `--batch` flag.

```sh
julia --threads=auto --project=. src/run.jl --batch batchs/campinas-random/intersection_cuts_relaxed_y/complete.batch > log_campinas_random_complete
```

In this case, the file `log_campinas_random_complete` contains all the logs, so, if you want to extract only the summaries, you can use the `grep` command.

```sh
grep -A1 "instance" log_campinas_random_complete
